Hi, I'm Carlos. A graduated Statistician/ Data Scientist with a Master's degree in applied mathematics. Through this website I hope to both: write more and also to showcase my work while I improve my english as well.

A more detailed view on my experience can be seen in my CV section or you can download a longer version [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B4LneyX0XF4ZYiVOdSR92qX7zQjWxptR/view?usp=sharing), the portfolio section will include (by the time I'm writing this) some personal projects and experiments, and finally you can also see my research on the publications tab.
